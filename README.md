# ICC Men's ODI World Cup 2023 Players Database
This is a group project of my Data Structure and Algorithm course, back in 2022. We were 4 members. Basically, this application stores ICC World Cup players data. We did it using file handling. We used linked-list in this project.
In this application one can add, update and delete any teams or players informations. We used c++ in it.

I build the insertion and Search part of this project.

## Screenshots
